1. Page size of operating system: 4096

2. The range of offset values that are valid for accessing the content of your files is 0 - 22662

3. What causes the program to crash when certain offset values are tried?

Anything below 4096, which is the SC_PAGESIZE value given to the pagesize to use, will cause the program to crash with a segmentation fault. Before it even hits the error for if the data is less than the page size, it gives a seg fault. The OS works with pages, so if the length of the offset is less than the page length, it will raise it automatically.

4. For what values does the program not crash?

Less than 4096, which is the size of the page assigned to the process.
